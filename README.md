Network Packet Analyzer

Creating a network packet analyzer, or packet sniffer, can be a great way to learn about network protocols and packet structures. However, it's important to emphasize that capturing network traffic should only be done with proper authorization and within ethical and legal boundaries.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of a packet sniffer using Python and the scapy library:

Packet Sniffer Implementation
First, ensure you have the scapy library installed:



Explanation:
Importing scapy and datetime:

scapy is used for packet sniffing and manipulation.
datetime is used to timestamp the captured packets.
Defining packet_callback function:

This function is called whenever a packet is captured.
It extracts the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol, and the payload from the packet.
It prints this information along with a timestamp.
Defining main function:

Starts the packet sniffer with the sniff function from scapy.
Uses the prn parameter to specify the callback function.
Uses the filter parameter to capture only IP packets.
The store parameter is set to 0 to avoid storing packets in memory.
Ethical Considerations:
Explicit Permission: Always get explicit permission from the network owner before running a packet sniffer.
Legal Compliance: Ensure your use of packet sniffers complies with all relevant laws and regulations.
Transparency: Clearly communicate the purpose and scope of the packet sniffer to all affected parties.
